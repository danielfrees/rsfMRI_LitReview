The corresponding attractor A was also found to be disrupted, with cross‐transitions from attractor A to B (Figure 7). Dynamic brain state one and two were characterized by high connectivity within the sensorimotor, auditory and visual domains on the one hand, and within the salience, default mode, and executive domains on the other, with anti‐correlations between these two. Interestingly, our static functional connectivity results also pointed toward a reduction in segregation of these anti‐correlated network domains in patients with incomplete recovery at trend level.
