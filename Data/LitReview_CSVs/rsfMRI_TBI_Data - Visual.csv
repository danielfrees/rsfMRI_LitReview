Volumes were then slice-time corrected and realigned. Despiking eliminated artifacts using ArtRepair’s despike filter. Coregistration was done in SPM8 using each participant’s T1-weighted image and the mean functional image. This coregistered image was segmented in SPM8 to normalize the image into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. These images were then resliced to 3 mm isotropic. To improve signal-to-noise ratio and reduce effects of anatomical differences, we applied a 6-mm isotropic smoothing filter to the normalized data. To address artifactual signal, time series from cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral white matter was sampled, averaged, and treated as regressors of no interest. The time series was then bandpass filtered from 0.01 to 0.12 Hz using the functional connectivity toolbox (CONN; https://www.nitrc.org/ projects/conn).
